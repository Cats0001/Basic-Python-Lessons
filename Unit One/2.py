# Basic functions

# Functions, which can also be called algorithms or methods, define code to be used later. A very common function
# used in almost all programs is "print", which simply displays the variable provided on the user's screen.
# print, and all other functions, takes it's data within parenthesis which follow the function name. Functions can
# take many types of data, and it is all dependant on how they are designed. See the print() example below.

print("See! This will be shown on the screen now")

# To finish this lesson, copy the following code to your console and execute it. Then read the next text block.

# print("Hello World")

# When you've finished this, congratulations! You've completed the quintessential "first" programming step.
# It is tradition to teach students this basic code as a first example of what you can do with functions. Give yourself
# a pat on the back.
