# Modify your previous project with these new requirements! You must also fulfill all of the previous requirements.

# Old requirements:
#       - Calculate the area of a rectangle, or square
#       - Asks the user which shape they would like to calculate, using input()
#       - Asks the user for the length and width of their shape, using input()
#       - Provide the user with the result of their calculation, using print()

# New requirements:
#       - All of the old requirements, plus:
#       - Run the program in a while loop, which terminates when the user responds "quit" to your first prompt
#       - Make the previous requirement clear to the user. They must know how to quit.
#       - Add a way for users to find the area of a random shape that is either a rectangle or triangle.
#       - If the calculated area is over 100, print "over 100" after displaying the area.
#       - If the calculated area if under 20, print "under 20" after displaying the area.
#       - If the calculated area is equal to 69, print "nice" after displaying the area.
#       - Do something extra that surprises me, and I'll find something to give you as a bonus. (not more airpods)

# When complete, show me your program. While working on the program feel free to ask questions, or google answers to
# SPECIFIC questions, do not copy paste a full program.
