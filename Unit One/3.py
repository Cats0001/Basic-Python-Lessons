# Basic Math

# Addition / Subtraction

result = 27 + 5

# See the code above? This will store the result of the math expression "27+5" as the variable "result". Math is very
# useful in code, and a fundamental understanding of mathematics will help you with your later coding endeavors.
# You can also add decimal float values together in the same manner, see the example below.

floatResult = 4.426 + 7.32

# Subtraction follows the same format, see examples below.

subtractionIntegers = 27 - 5

subtractionFloat = 4.426 - 7.32

# Notice the final example will be a negative number? These work in the same manner as positive numbers. If you print
# the final example, you'll be given a value of -2.894

# Multiplication / Division

multiplication = 5*7

# Multiplication follows a format again much like you would see in a traditional math class, numberOne followed by an
# asterisk and then your second number. Division uses a symbol you may not have used in math before, though.

division = 100/5

# In this example, the division sign is replaced by a forward slash, but other than that it is largely the same as
# multiplication. For clarification, the above example is 100 divided by 5.

# Exponents

exponents = 5 ** 2

# Exponents are expressed as two subsequent multiplication symbols, but you likely won't use this for a while.

# To complete this lesson, try it out! Experiment in your python console with different types of math operations.
