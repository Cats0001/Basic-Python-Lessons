# This is a free project. Come up with a program that incorporates all of what you have learned in
# lessons / projects 0-9. This project will require creativity, and may take some time. Be prepared.

# The only requirement is to demonstrate your knowledge. Good luck.

# Some project ideas:
#       - Approximate flight time calculator, based on the speed of popular airliners and consumer planes.
#       - Supermarket item calculator, register system which displays numbers on screen.
#       - Battleship simulation, shown in 2D or fully text.
#       - Number guessing game (guess the computers number, user can choose difficulty)
#       - Or anything you can think of! The only bounds are you own creativity and skill.
